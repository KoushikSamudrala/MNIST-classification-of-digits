#project description

In this project, the task of handwritten digits classsification is done using Tensorflow module in python.
MNIST is the dataset consists of images and labels of handwritten digits ranging from 0-9 with variations in orientations of digits.
All the digits are of grayscaled images of size 60.000 training samples and 10000 test samples.

we will be using CNN architecture to solve this task of digit classification.
